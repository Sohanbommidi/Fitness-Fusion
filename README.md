Project Title: AUGMENTING DATA CATALOGS BY INCORPORATING DATA FITNESS DISTRIBUTIONS

The core objective of our project was to address prevalent issues within data catalogs, encompassing challenges related to feature comprehension, insights generation, awareness enhancement, and analytical scope. These are crucial elements missing in existing data catalogs, prompting us to devise a solution that elevates catalog functionality. In our endeavor, we introduced several key features to enhance the catalog's utility. Among these, the incorporation of Common Data Fitness stands as a pivotal tool to assess the data quality matrix comprehensively. Additionally, the integration of Domain-Specific Fitness serves to ascertain the relevance score, crucial in contextualizing data significance. Moreover, the inclusion of a thumbnail feature significantly enhances user understanding by providing a concise visual representation of the respective data catalog.

By synergizing both Common Data Fitness and Domain-Specific Fitness, we formulated an overarching fitness score for the data catalog, a metric crucial for users to gauge the overall data quality. Leveraging the TextRank algorithm, we adeptly distilled comprehensive summaries from the data catalogs, empowering users with condensed yet informative insights. Furthermore, our utilization of LDA Topic Modeling proved instrumental in identifying key topics within the catalogsâ€”essentially pinpointing the pivotal columns that encapsulate vital information.

In our pursuit to empower users with tools for efficient data comprehension, we devised a systematic approach to identify key variables within datasets. Parameters such as information content, consistency, correlation, and variability were meticulously employed to discern the variables harboring the most significant data. This comprehensive approach ensures that users can discern and prioritize variables that contribute substantially to the dataset, thereby streamlining the analytical process and enhancing the utility of the data catalog.
